# Developer Portfolio and University Notes

This repository serves as my developer [portfolio](https://www.brayanmuniz.com/) and a place to hold my university notes. 

# Markdown Styling 
The markdown styling for this project was inspired by the work of [iamcco](https://github.com/iamcco). Specifically, the [markdown-preview.nvim](https://github.com/iamcco/markdown-preview.nvim) plugin provided significant inspiration. 

# A note on note taking 
I use an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) style of note taking in markdown files in order to connect ideas together.

In order to not leave my editor I use this [plugin](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim) 

I use [Neovim](https://neovim.io) btw
