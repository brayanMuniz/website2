# Reductions
The idea of reduction can be thought of like this.  
You have some problem $X$ and you do not know how to solve that problem, but you know how to solve another problem $Y$.  
If you can ***reduce*** $X$ to $Y$ then you can solve this problem. 

However, the validity of $X$ can not depend on the ***reduction*** algorithm that we used for $Y$.   
You can think of this as a black box or a library from a programming language.
