# Maxflow-Mincut Theorem
[video](https://youtu.be/LdOnanfc5TM?si=fPoW_mZTUKgRjr_s) 


Augmenting paths - possible path 
- bottle neck value: the smallest value along this path.  

Augment the flow 
- update the value along the Augmenting path
- use the bottleneck value to update the value along the path.  
- you also create a *residual graph*, this goes backwards along your augmenting path and helps to undo bad choices you have made.   

Residual Graph
