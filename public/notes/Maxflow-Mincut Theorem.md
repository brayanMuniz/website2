# Maxflow-Mincut Theorem
> This is also known as the Ford-Fulkerson Augmenting Path Algorithm

[video](https://youtu.be/LdOnanfc5TM?si=fPoW_mZTUKgRjr_s) 

In order to find your [Maximum Flow](notes/Maximum%20Flow.md), you must find you [Minimum Cuts](notes/Minimum%20Cuts.md).  

Play around the bottle necks, using **augmenting paths**.  
How you find these paths is unspecified and is left up to the developer.
