The trace of a ***square*** matrix, denoted by "tr", is simply the sum of the diagonal elements. 

$$
  \text{tr} A = \sum_{i=1}^{n} A_{ii}
$$

The trace has some unique properties that make manipulating equations pretty neat. 
- $\text{tr} A B = \text{tr} B A$
  - This can be expanded by popping the variable to the front every time
  - $\text{tr}ABCD = \text{tr}DABC = \text{tr}CDAB = \text{tr}BCDA$
- $\text{tr} A = \text{tr} A^T$
- $\text{tr}(A + B) = \text{tr} A + \text{tr} B$
- $\text{tr} (aA) = a \, \text{tr} A$
