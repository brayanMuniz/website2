# Induction
[Khan Academy Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wblW_M_HVQ8) 

You want to prove something that depends on the previous part, and if you prove one point, you can the subsequently prove all the points. 

1. Basis Step: Prove that $P(1)$ is true
2. Induction Step: Assume $P(k)$ is true, prove $P(k+1)$ is true

> If you want to abstract this and want to prove it at some point $a$ instead of $1$, you can prove it at $P(a)$ instead
