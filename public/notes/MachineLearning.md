# [**Supervised Learning**](./Supervised-Learning)
- [**Linear Regression**](./LinearRegression)
  - A method for predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more input features.
- [**Classification**](./Classification)
  - A technique for assigning input data into predefined categories or classes.
  - [**Logistic Regression**](./Logistic-Regression)
     - A regression model used for binary classification that predicts the probability of a class.
  - [**Newton's Method**](./Newtons-Method) 
    - An optimization algorithm used to find the parameters that minimize the cost function in logistic regression and other models.
  - [**Support Vector Machines**](./SVM) 
    - A powerful classification method that finds the hyperplane that best separates the classes in the feature space.


# Resources and Misc 
This class is/was taken at UT Dallas: CS 4375 Introduction to Machine Learning and taught by Erick Parolin.   

For extra resources and notes, you can take a look at the [Standford Open Course](https://see.stanford.edu/Course/CS229).   

> Note: Because of the use of external resources, the notation will differ, because of this, I will be following the notation from the Stanford course, just in case if I ever want to go back and reread the material, but the general idea should be the same.
