# Database
A database is a collection of related data. 

## The mini world 
I like to think of a database as a representation between the interpreted real world, some processing and organizing, and the result is a "mini world"   

- The DB must logically represent this mini world
- The data is designed and built around this idea of the mini world. 

To help with this we use [Database Management Systems](./DBMS.md)
