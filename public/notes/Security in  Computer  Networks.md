### Symmetric Key Cryptography 
> This is also known as Private Key Cryptography 

This is a pretty simple system of encryption, both parties are able to encrypt and decrypt the data with a shared key. The problem is ***how*** both parties can get this key without any interference or spoofing by a third party.  

### Public Key Cryptography 
All parities have a public **and** a private key.  

Main things to look out for: 
- public key cryptography
  - this is used to distribute session key? 
- Key distribution center: Used to verify that someone is who they say they are with the key provided. Prevents impersonations   
- How to authenticate to each other? 
- Nonce: a number used once in a lifetime, in this way, you can prevent "replay attacks" 
- malicious nonce?
