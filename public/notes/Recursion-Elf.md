# Recursion-Elf

| フリーレン | Description|
| -------------- | --------------- |
| ![furiren](../Images/elf.jpeg) | [Erikson](https://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/) has this idea of the Recursion Fairy, but I will refer to it as the Recursion Elf.  |

The whole point of this Elf, is for you to not worry about the underlying details of how the recursion algorithm works.
