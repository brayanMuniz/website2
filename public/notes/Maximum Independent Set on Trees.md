# Maximum Independent Set on Trees
An independent set of a graph is a subset of vertices with no edges between them. The maximum independent set problem asks for the largest independent set in a graph. This problem is really really hard. In fact, it's one of the examples that most people believe doesn't have a polynomial time algorithm at all.
