# Entity-Relationship Model
![erModel](../Images/erModel.png) 

## Types of attributes
- Composite Attributes: Attributes that can be subdivided into smaller parts. 
- Atomic Attributes: Attributes that can not be divided into smaller parts. 
I like to think of these as a tree, with atomic being the leaves and composite being everything else.
