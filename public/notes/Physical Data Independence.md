# Physical Data Independence
The only thing the applications have to worry about is the logical place of where the data can be retrieved, and you don't have to worry about the physical address of where it is.   
This is integral to [DBMS](notes/DBMS.md) and is one of the reasons why it is so useful.  
It seems more and more that this looks like more like an API that has all the complexities of data storage abstracted away in order to let users store and deal with the logical data instead of the raw data.
