# Classification 
We want to classify some discreet values in our dataset, $y \in \{0,1...\}$
You cant apply a linear function to the data set, because it wont fit as well.  
What you can do is change the linear function and "squish" it down using the [Sigmoid Function](./Sigmoid-Function.md) to change it into a classification function.
