# Neural Networks
[3Blue1Brown](https://youtu.be/aircAruvnKk?si=AEWQFv26EGUpokCk)  
- Uses [Perceptron](notes/Perceptron.md)

## Using ReLu over Sigmoid 
Many modern Neural Networks use [ReLu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier_(neural_networks)) over the [Sigmoid Function](notes/Sigmoid-Function.md) because it is much faster to train on.  

- Input Layer 
- Hidden Layers 
These are your layers of abstraction that can represent the next part of the layer. For example if you wanted to recognize hand drawn numbers, you would recognize the loop in a $9$, but you can go back one layer to recognize that loop.  
- Output Layer
