# Recursion
This is a very powerful form of [Reduction](./Reductions.md)  

It can be thought of this way:
- If the problem can be solved directly, solve it. AKA the ***base case***  
- If the problem can be broken down into a simpler problem, do it. 

| Explanation | フリーレン|
| -------------- | --------------- |
| Erikson likes to call the second part of the problem as handing off the details to a Recursion Fairy, personally I am going to stick with the Elf. | ![F](../Images/フリーレン.jpeg) |

> There is one condition that must be satisfied: It can not go on forever. If you are never finding a base case, try another method.
