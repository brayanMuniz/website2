# Peer to Peer 
There is no centralized host, as opposed to a [Client Server Model](./Client%20Server%20Model.md), communication is done directly from one client to another.  
One of the most popular peer to peer applications is a file sharing application protocol called BitTorrent.  
This can also easily scale, because of the iterative nature of just adding clients to the "workload".
