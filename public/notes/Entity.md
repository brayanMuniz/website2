# Entity
In [Database Design](./Database%20Design.md) I like to think about entities as things that can live by themselves, independent of the database logic you are applying, an actual thing in the mini world you are creating.  
This is similar to objects in objects oriented design.  

## Attributes 
Each entity has attributes, similar again to OOP.
