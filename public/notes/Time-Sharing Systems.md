# Time-Sharing Systems
 A single CPU can run multiple programs by rapidly switching between them, giving the illusion that they are running simultaneously. The operating system divides CPU time into small slices and allocates them to each program in turn. This technique is called time-sharing.

## Context Switching
The CPU saves the state of a currently running program (context) and loads the state of the next program to be run. This allows the CPU to switch between programs efficiently, enabling multitasking.
