# All-Pairs Shortest Paths
A way to get the shortest path from every vertex to every other vertex.  
The desired output should be a $V \times V$ table that has the path from every Vertex to every other Vertex.  
This should be very helpful in the [Network Layer](notes/Network%20Layer.md) for example, when trying to find the shortest path for each router.
