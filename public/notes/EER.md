# Enhanced Entity Relationship Model 
[Entity-Relationship Model](notes/ER%20Model.md)
Think of OOP, you can generalize and abstract data types.  
Use subset symbol to identify it.  

use **d** to signify that they can only be one, *disjoint*  
use **o** for overlap: some part you will find here and you will find there.    
  - here or there, or in both  

creating things, you go top down
deleting things, you go bottom up
