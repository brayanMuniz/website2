# Multiprocessor
Refers to a system with more than one physical processor, each with its own cores. These processors may share a single memory or have separate memory, depending on the architecture. Multiprocessors can handle more tasks simultaneously compared to a single [Multicore](./Multicore.md) processor but are more complex to manage in terms of communication and synchronization.
