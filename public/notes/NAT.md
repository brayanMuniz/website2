# NAT
> Translates one set of IP addresses to another set of IP addresses 

[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTUV0t6JaDA) 

Because of the limited amount of IP addresses in IPv4, we use this in order to preserve the amount of IP addresses.  
It does this by taking the **Private** addresses of a home network and merges them all into one **Public**, IP address.
