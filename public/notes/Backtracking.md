You need to make a sequence of decision.  
Look at the correct decision.  
For each option, [recursively](notes/Recursion.md) look at the consequences at that one choice.

- Several feasible solutions.  
- Each has a value
- Want solution that maximizes/minimizes that value, depends on what you want.
