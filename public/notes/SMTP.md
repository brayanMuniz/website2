# SMTP
- Uses TCP 

- User agents 
- Mail servers 
- Transfer Protocol: SMTP
- Mail access protocols: POP/IMAP

## Example 
If you have user_agent_1 and it wants to send it to user_agent_2, and there are 2 mail_servers in between.  
user_agent_1 sends to mail_server_1 and then mail_server_1 acts as client to mail_server_2 and so on to user_agent_2
