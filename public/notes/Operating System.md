# Operating System
An OS is a program that controls the execution of application programs, and acts as an interface between applications and the computer hardware. It can be thought of as having three objectives
- Convenience: An OS makes a computer more convenient to use. (unless you use Arch Linux)
- Efficiency: An OS allows the computer system resources to be used in an efficient manner.
- Ability to evolve: An OS should be constructed in such a way as to permit the effective development, testing, and introduction of new system functions without interfering with service.
