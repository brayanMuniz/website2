# Denotational Semantics
- The process of constructing a denotational semantics specification for a programming language requires one to define **for each language entity** both **a mathematical object** and **a function** that maps instances of that language entity onto instances of the mathematical object.

- The method is named **denotational** because the mathematical objects denote the meaning of their corresponding syntactic entities.
