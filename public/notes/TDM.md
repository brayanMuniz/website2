# TDM
> Time division multiplexing 

Divide time into a **Time Frame** then divide that into how many nodes you are trying to handle $N$.  
Each Node gets fair time.  

If a Node is the only one "Speaking", then it is limited by the amount of time slots that it has.  
If the transmission rate is $R$ then it is limited to $\frac{R}{N}$
