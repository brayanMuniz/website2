# Interrupts
A way to ***interrupt*** the process of the processor.  
An obvious use of this is when there is an error in the process by another module, memory, I/O, etc... 

## Processor Utilization 
The processor is much faster than I/O operations, we have to find some way to handle the request of the I/O and then come back to what we were doing.
