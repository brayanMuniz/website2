# Divide-And-Conquer
The idea can be broken up into 3 parts. 
1. **Divide**: Break up the problem into a smaller problem, of the ***same*** problem. 
2. **Delegate**: Hand off each smaller part to the [Recursion-Elf](notes/Recursion-Elf)
3. **Combine**: Each solution from the Elf back into the bigger solution.
