# BNF
- A metalanguage  
- natural notation for describing syntax
- uses abstractions for syntactic structures

## An example 
A simple Java assignment statement, for example, might be represented by the abstraction `<assign>`  
`<assign> â†’ <var> = <expression> `  
LHS is the abstraction being defined and the RHS is the definition of the LHS.
